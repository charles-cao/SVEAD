## 📊 Algorithm Overview

SVEAD partitions the feature space using Voronoi tessellation with randomly sampled anchor points. For each test sample, the anomaly score is computed based on:

1. **Relative Position**: Distance to nearest anchor normalized by cell radius
2. **Cell Density**: Average density of the assigned Voronoi cell
3. **Ensemble Averaging**: Scores averaged across multiple random tessellations

**Anomaly Score Formula:**
```
score = (dist_to_anchor / max_dist_in_cell) × (mean_dist_in_cell / global_max_mean_dist)
```

Where:
- `dist_to_anchor`: Distance from test point to its nearest anchor
- `max_dist_in_cell`: Maximum distance in the assigned cell (computed on training set)
- `mean_dist_in_cell`: Average distance in the assigned cell (computed on training set)
- `global_max_mean_dist`: Maximum mean distance across all cells (for normalization)

## 🚀 Installation

### Requirements
```bash
pip install torch numpy scikit-learn
```

**Minimum versions:**
- Python >= 3.8
- PyTorch >= 2.0
- NumPy >= 1.20
- scikit-learn >= 1.0 (optional, for evaluation metrics)


## 📖 Quick Start

### Basic Usage
```python
import numpy as np
from svead import SVEAD

# Generate sample data
X_train = np.random.randn(10000, 10)  # 10k samples, 10 features
X_test = np.random.randn(1000, 10)    # 1k test samples

# Initialize and fit
model = SVEAD(max_samples=256, t=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train)

# Compute anomaly scores
scores = model.decision_function(X_test)

# Higher scores indicate more anomalous samples
threshold = np.percentile(scores, 95)  # Top 5% as anomalies
predictions = (scores > threshold).astype(int)
```

### With Evaluation
```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score, average_precision_score

# Assuming y_test contains true labels (0: normal, 1: anomaly)
auc_roc = roc_auc_score(y_test, scores)
auc_pr = average_precision_score(y_test, scores)

print(f"AUC-ROC: {auc_roc:.4f}")
print(f"AUC-PR:  {auc_pr:.4f}")
```

## 🎛️ Parameters
```python
SVEAD(
    max_samples=256,      # Number of anchor points per tessellation
    t=100,                # Number of ensemble tessellations
    random_state=None     # Random seed for reproducibility
)
```

### Parameter Guidelines

| Parameter | Description | Typical Range | Impact |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| `max_samples` | Anchor points per tessellation | 16-512 | Higher = finer granularity, more memory |
| `n_estimators` | Number of tessellations | 50-200 | Higher = more stable, slower |
| `random_state` | Random seed | Any int | For reproducibility |

**Memory Usage (approximate):**
- Training: `O(n × d + t × max_samples × d)` where n=samples, d=features
- Inference: `O(batch_size × d + t × max_samples × d)`

### Batch Processing for Large Datasets
```python
# For very large test sets, adjust batch_size
scores = model.decision_function(X_test, batch_size=50000)  # Smaller batches = less memory
```

### Device Selection
```python
# SVEAD automatically selects the best available device
# Priority: CUDA > MPS (Apple Silicon) > CPU

# Check which device is being used
print(f"Using device: {model.device}")
```
